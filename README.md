# alexa-daily-workout-challenge
An Alexa skill for Amazon Echo, that guides a user through a daily, approximately 10 minute workout.  This was created as part of the Bloc.io curriculum and not currently released in production.

I changed the personality of Alexa recently, to be focused at the motorsports driver 'niche', embodying the personality of Ricky Bobby!

In the future, I will be adding several features and there is an open invitation to anyone who wants to work on this skill with me.  Check it out, fork away and let me know if you want to contribute.
